Practicing Ruby
 -make variables with the name of what you want to do ex. verb, noun, etc.
 - have it equal a gets.chomp
 - the gets is so the user can input something before ruby processes anything.
 -the chomp os to take off the /n(which means a line break) form the phase/statement
 -add a puts above the variable with a string so you can tell the user what they should be inputting. ex. puts 'write a verb'
    -not that if you do a return before the line reaches the end of the page, it adds a /n.(I believe this is because it is in the next row)
-use p at the beginning to "print" what you coded
-write down the text and and use #{the variable name} within the string to create a string interpolation.

    for some reason I can't use the same variable to input different words into the mad libs. once i filled the first three instances of the variable, it filled the rest with the same inputs. 
    I created different  variable for each one and it worked.

-tried to put two nouns first before an adj to see  if it would let me have different inputs, but it still only let me have three inputs and auto filled the rest.
